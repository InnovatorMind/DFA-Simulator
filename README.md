# DFA Playground (Beta)
An interactive visualizer for **Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA)**, enabling users to **generate and explore DFA representations dynamically**.

## 🚀 Features
- **DFA Diagram Generation** – Instantly visualize DFA states and transitions based on user-defined patterns.
- **String Tester** – Enter custom strings to verify if they are accepted by the DFA.
- **Interactive Controls** – Modify DFA configurations and see real-time updates.

## ⚙️ Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/InnovatorMind/DFA_Playground.git
   ```
2. **Navigate into the project**:
   ```sh
   cd dfa-playground
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```sh

   ```
4. **Start the development server**:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **React** – Front-end framework
- **Tailwind CSS** – Styling
- **Vis.js** – DFA visualization

## 🎨 Usage
1. Choose an operation (**Starts With, Ends With, Contains**).
2. Define a pattern to generate the DFA.
3. Test strings to see if they are accepted.
4. Explore the **graphical representation of DFA processing**.
